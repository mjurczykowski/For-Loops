# Loops Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to practice writing loops so we feel comfortable with the process of using them for more challenging tasks.  Read each description and write a loop inside each function.

## Programming
I will supply you with code to check to see if your answers are correct.  Copy and paste the code in check.js to the bottom of your program and run it to give you output messages.


### positiveIntSum
Add the numbers from 1 to n.  The function only needs one input **limit** since all patterns here start with 1.  Yes, the point is to type what you wrote in the notes.  However this time return the answer.

### additionPatternSum
Write the code for the third example with the variable **start**, **diff**, and **limit** encorporated in the function declaration.  Make sure to return your answer.


### multiplicationPatternSum
This example should also rely on the notes, particulary the while loop example.  The goal is to add up all numbers under a certain limit, which we will call **max** to differentiate it from the previous examples.  The three input variables should be **start**, **factor**, and **max**.




## Investigation
Use the functions that you wrote above to answer the following questions.  To solve the questions correctly you will need to ask yourself the following questions.
-  How does the pattern work?
-  Which function should I use?
-  What would the inputs be?
-  How should I console.log the answers?


### Patterns
For each questions, type the answer instead of the question-mark (?) once you use the program to solve for it.  You will need to delete the checking code and write your own console.log() statements.


-  **Q1:**  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 1500 = ?


-  **Q2:**  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 2000000 = ?


-  **Q3:**  -80 + -20 + 40 + 100 + ... (50 times) = ?


-  **Q4:**  4 + 12 + 36 + 108 + ... + (under 50,000) = ?


-  **Q5:**  7 + 14 + 28 + 56 + ... + (under 50,000) = ?


-  **Q6:**  Which answer was larger, question 2 or question 3?  Why do you think so?


-  **Q7:**  2 + -6 + 18 + -54 + 162 + ... (under 1000000)= ?
